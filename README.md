# moiki-exporter
This repository provides tools to export your stories made with Moiki to other formats

---

Well known formats:

+ **Inkle's Ink** - Ink is the language of Inkle's Studio. Export your _Moiki_ story in this format and open it with [Inky](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/).
+ **Twee (Harlowe 3.1.0)** - Twee is the format behind [Twine](https://twinery.org/) and Harlowe is the default _story-format_ used in Twine2. It will allows you to compile your _moiki_ story to be Twine compatible with the help of [TweeGO](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/).
+ **Twee (SugarCube 2.31.1)** - SugarCube is another _story-format_ available for Twee. This one is the most used by Twee/Twine users. Like Harlowe export, it will allows you to compile your _moiki_ story to be Twine compatible with the help of [TweeGO](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/).
+ **Inform (v6)** - [Inform](http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Inform_6) is a programming language and design system for interactive fiction. Export your _Moiki_ story in this format and compile it in z-code (v3, v5 or v8) to run on lots of retro computers!
+ **PDF** - Convert your story in a book _Ã  la_ CYOA! If you like those old 80s books, give it a try!

Others formats are also available:
+ **JDR-Bot** - [JDR-Bot](https://github.com/Cyril-Fiesta/jdr-bot) is a french discord bot that allows teams to play _roleplay games_. This export will allows you to transform your _Moiki_ story in a scenario for this bot.
