# moiki-exporter
This repository provides tools to export your stories made with Moiki to other formats

---

This is a _work in progress_!

Well known formats:
+ **Inkle's Ink** - Ink is the language of Inkle's Studio. Export your _Moiki_ story in this format and open it with [Inky](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/).
+ **Twee (Harlowe 3.1.0)** - Twee is the format behind [Twine](https://twinery.org/) and Harlowe is the default _story-format_ used in Twine2. It will allows you to compile your _moiki_ story to be Twine compatible with the help of [TweeGO](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/).
+ **Twee (SugarCube 2.31.1)** - SugarCube is another _story-format_ available for Twee. This one is the most used by Twee/Twine users. Like Harlowe export, it will allows you to compile your _moiki_ story to be Twine compatible with the help of [TweeGO](https://www.motoslave.net/tweego/).

Others formats are also available:
+ **JDR-Bot** - [JDR-Bot](https://github.com/Cyril-Fiesta/jdr-bot) is a french discord bot that allows teams to play _roleplay games_. This export will allows you to transform your _Moiki_ story in a scenario for this bot.

_Other formats are on the way. Stay tuned!_

## Howto

Export your story made on Moiki as JSON format ([documentation](https://moiki.fr/documentation/export) - *french only*) and drag the downloaded _.zip_ file on [Moiki-Exporter website](https://moiki-exporter.netlify.app/). Then you can choose the export format that you want.
