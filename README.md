# moiki-exporter
This repository provides tools to export your stories made with Moiki to other formats

---

Well known formats:
+ **Inform (v6)** - [Inform](http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Inform_6) is a programming language and design system for interactive fiction. Export your _Moiki_ story in this format and compile it in z-code (v3, v5 or v8) to run on lots of retro computers!
+ **Inkle's Ink** - Ink is the language of Inkle's Studio. Export your _Moiki_ story in this format and open it with [Inky](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/).
+ **PDF** - If you choose _simplified story_ when you created your story, then you can convert it in a book _Ã  la_ CYOA! There's also a few options to customize it.
