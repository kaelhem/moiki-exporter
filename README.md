# moiki-exporter
This repository provides tools to export your stories made with Moiki to other formats

---

This is a _work in progress_!

Until now, you can use this tool to convert your stories made with [Moiki](https://moiki.fr) to these formats:
+ Inkle's Ink
+ Twee (Harlowe 3.1.0)
+ [JDR-Bot](https://github.com/Cyril-Fiesta/jdr-bot)

Other formats are on the way!

## Howto

Export your story made on Moiki ([documentation](https://moiki.fr/documentation/export) - *french only*) and drag the json file on [Moiki-Exporter website](https://moiki-exporter.netlify.app/). Then you can choose the export format that you want.
